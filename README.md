# Node.js Boilerplate

This is the boiler plate that should be used for all Node.js services codebase.

Click [here](docs/FOLDERS.md) to go through details for each folder.

## Scripts
1. `npm run lint`  
    This runs linting on the service code.

2. `npm run test`  
    Runs all tests present in the service.
    Tests **MUST** have `.test.js` extension.

Other scripts can be added as needed.

**Note**:  
`npm run lint` is automatically run before git push.  
Also, the code is made pretty (prettify) during commit.

**Commit guidelines:**
